\title{Calculate light absorption in pure water}
\usage{
absorption(driver, absorb_coef = 0.1521645)
}
\arguments{
\item{driver}{The site driver file}

\item{absorb_coef}{Absorption coefficient of clear water. Defaults to the
value derived from Pope & Fry (1997) as explained above (absorb_coef = 0.1521645).}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe of predicted light at the benthic surface and the
irradiance attenuation coefficient.
}
\description{
Calculates light absorption as a function of depth in clear water,
using the mean absorption coefficient for pure water derived from
Pope & Fry 1997 Absorption spectrum ~380â€“700 nm of pure water. II.
Integrating cavity measurements. Effectively, this assumes that attenuation is
solely a function of absorption from pure water. In other words, the irradiance
attenuation coefficient (Kd) will be equal to just the absorption coefficient for
pure water.
